# Reflections
A simple 2D game written in C++ as my intake for NHTV IGAD in Breda.

This simple 2D game was made using SDL: https://www.libsdl.org
The theme of the assignment was "Reflections". I interpreted this as having multiple worlds that you
can teleport between while your location remains the same. The world are "reflections" of eachother.
You have to solve levels by navigating between worlds and finding your way to the flag at the end.

Please note:
This is my first time writing a large project in C++, and as such this contains multiple design flaws.
If you are reading this and thinking of using any of the code, feel free to do so. Just keep in mind
that some parts of the project design are questionable and prone to error (I only found out afterward).
